### Code Academy - Final Project - Markov Chains/Web Scraper
### New Shakespeare Poem Generator

For my final project for Code Academy, using Markov Chains, I decided to create a poem generator that scrapes Sonnets 1-154 of William Shakespeare from literaturepage.com and generated them into a new poem.

*To run, clone this repository and run NewShakespeare.py*


Codecademy Markov Chain text generator module. This is an implementation of a Markov Chain that generates random text based on content provided by the user. It is designed to be used as a local Python module for instructional purposes.

### How to add this to your project
Clone this repository into your Python project folder. Alternatively, you can download the zip archive and extract it into a directory in your project folder called markov_python.
You will need to import this file based on it's relative path. If your main runnable Python script is in the same directory as the markov_python directory, you can import this by including the following at the top of the runnable script: from markov_python.cc_markov import MarkovChain
How to use the Markov Chain text generator
After importing this module into your main project script, create an instance of MarkovChain and assign it to a variable. For example mc = MarkovChain()
Use one of the methods to read a local text file or a string. You can call this method multiple times to add additional data.
Call the generate_text() function on the instance of MarkovChain you created to generate text from the Markov Chain. You can call this method multiple times to generate additional data. This function will output a list of words. If your project requires a different format, you should convert the output accordingly.
